## Installation

Ensure KUBECONFIG points to the target Kubernetes cluster.

If you are using a single node Kubernetes cluster, then ensure you label the node with `node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=`.

```
kubectl label node $NODENAME node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=
```

Deploy the operator by running the following command.
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/confidential-containers/operator/main/deploy/deploy.yaml
```
The operator deploys all resources under `confidential-containers-system` namespace.

## Create Custom Resource (CR)
```
kubectl apply  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/confidential-containers/operator/main/config/samples/ccruntime.yaml
```

## Verify

- Check the status of operator PODs.

```
kubectl get pods -n confidential-containers-system
```
A successful install should show all PODs with "Running" status

```
NAME                                             READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
cc-operator-controller-manager-dc4846d94-nfnr7   2/2     Running       0          20h
cc-operator-daemon-install-bdp89                 1/1     Running       0          5s
cc-operator-pre-install-daemon-hclk9             1/1     Running       0          9s
```

- Check `RuntimeClasses`

```
kubectl get runtimeclass
```
A successful install should show the following `RuntimeClasses`
```
NAME        HANDLER     AGE
kata        kata        6m7s
kata-clh    kata-clh    6m7s
kata-qemu   kata-qemu   6m7s
```

## Changing Runtime bundle

You can change the runtime payload when creating the CR by changing the `payloadImage` attribute in the 
[manifest yaml](https://github.com/confidential-containers/operator/blob/main/config/samples/ccruntime.yaml#L14)


## Uninstallation

Delete the CR
```
kubectl delete  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/confidential-containers/operator/main/config/samples/ccruntime.yaml
```

Delete the Operator
```
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/confidential-containers/operator/main/deploy/deploy.yaml
```
